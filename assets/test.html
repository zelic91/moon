<p class="first">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over  in my mind ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever  you feel like criticizing any one,&quot; he told me, &quot;just remember that  all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I  understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm  inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious  natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The  abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it  appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly  accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of  wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have  feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some  unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for  the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they  express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.  Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of  missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I  snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out  unequally at birth.</p>
<p>And, after  boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain  point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last  autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral  attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses  into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was  exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an  unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures,  then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the  promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that  register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing  to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of  the &quot;creative temperament&quot;--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a  romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it  is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right at the  end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his  dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded  elations of men.</p><div class="sidebar left" id="sidebar1_1_2"></a>

<p>My family have  been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three  generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that  we're descended from the <a class="toggler" id="r1_1_2">Dukes of Buccleuch</a>, but the actual founder of  my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a <a class="toggler" id="r1_1_3">substitute</a>  to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father  carries on today.</p><div class="sidebar left" id="sidebar1_1_4"></div>
<p>I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with special reference to the  rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from <a class="toggler" id="r1_1_4">New  Haven</a> in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little  later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.  I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of  being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged  edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond business.  Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one  more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were  choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, &quot;Why--ye-es&quot; with  very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year and after  various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of  twenty-two.</p>
<p>The practical  thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just  left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the  office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded  like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at  eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I  went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days  until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and  cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric  stove.</p>
<p>It was lonely for  a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped  me on the road.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you  get to <a href="maps://m-3-1" id="m-3-1" class="map toggler">West Egg</a> village?&quot; he asked helplessly.</p>
<div class="sidebar left" id="sidebar1_1_5"></div>
<p>I told him. And  as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original  settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>And so with the  sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees--just as things  grow in fast movies--I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning  over again with the summer.</p>
<p>There was so much  to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the  young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and  investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money  from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only <a class="toggler" id="r1_1_5">Midas and  Morgan and Maecenas</a>  knew. And I had the high intention of reading many  other books besides. I was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a  series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the &quot;Yale News&quot;--and  now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again  that most limited of all specialists, the &quot;well-rounded man.&quot; This  isn't just an epigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single  window, after all.</p>
